CNNs are practical for 2 main reasons
1. They effectively reduce the number of input nodes, which is great if you're looking at a detailed image with many pixels
2. They look for correlated features instead of 'hard' locations
        This allows them to tolerate small shifts/translations in an object's location within the image


CNNs lose out when
1. they need to recognise a feature that has undergone transformations other than translation (tilt/rotation/big scaling)
2. adversarial examples: adding a small amount of noise to an image can really fuck with a CNN's ability to recognise an image
   even if they look basically identical to a human!
3. CNNs are slower
4. CNNs need larger training datasets
